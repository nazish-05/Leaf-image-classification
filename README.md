The project implements a multi-model image classification system for detecting diseases in leaf images using three popular deep learning architectures: EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Using the Gradio interface, users can upload an image and select one of the models to classify the leaf into predefined disease classes. The uploaded notebook shows that the models are built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the system is hosted via Gradio for an interactive experience. As demonstrated in the screenshots, the same leaf image is tested using different models. EfficientNetB0 predicted the class as class13, while ResNet50 predicted it as class12, showing slight variation in output depending on the architecture used. MobileNetV2 also participated in the evaluation, though its prediction is not shown in the screenshots. This experiment highlights how model architecture influences classification results, and the interactive setup allows quick switching between models to compare their performance visually and functionally.
